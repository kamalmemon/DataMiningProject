# DataMiningProject
Course project for Algorithmic Designs of Data Mining - Aalto University .

The tasks concerning this project are outlined in project.pdf and a report of our proceedings is in Report.pdf

The following libraries are required to run the computation:
1. numpy
2. networkx
3. networkit

The packages could be easily installed locally using pip and pip3.

The code is distributed into four jupyter notebooks, each representing each graph for which we have done approximations and exact computations:

- graph-stats.ipynb
- graph-stats+2.ipynb
- graph-stats+3.ipynb
- graph-stats+4.ipynb

Apart from the ANF Approximation which is in the following file, all approximation schemes are done in the jupyter notebooks:

- ANF- Hop Plot approximation.ipynb

The comparison graph and plots for each method is available in:

- Accuracy plots.ipynb

Moreover, for exact computations and component extractions the scripts were ran in force.aalto.fi. These scripts are:

- component_extraction.py
- exact_statistics.py
